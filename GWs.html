  <h1>Optical counterparts of GWs  </h1>
  <p>I am going to put here some material that is supporting my work in searching and studying the emission from counterparts of gravitational wave events</p>
  <h2>Host galaxies list</h2>
  <p>Let's start with a project that is based on creating a list of most probable host galaxies of these events, based on some properties of the host itself and the error region provided by each single GW event. </p>
